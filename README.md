Answer a few basic questions. Then find the friend with the greatest compatibility!

##About the App
Answer each question to what best suits you. The application will convert each user's results and compare the difference between your score against those from other submissions question by question. It will add up the difference to calculate the total difference.

Once the application has found your most compatible friend, it will display the name of the person and their photo.
